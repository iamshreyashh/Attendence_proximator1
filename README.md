Hey guys !! 

Just built this webpage for my college peeps so that they can keep an eye on their eye on attendance percentage and still bunk the classes!!

P.S: in our college if att. is < 90 then â‚¹400/percent fine is imposed sadly:(
Here's the link: https://iamshreyashh.github.io/Attendence_proximator1.github.io/
